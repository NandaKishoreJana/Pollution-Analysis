CASE STUDY: POLLUTION ANALYSIS

Central Government wants to analyze about the pollution from land transportation vehicles. So they've approached you and asked you to analyze the transport vehicles' 
contribution to the pollution. They would like you to create an application which provides information about the vehicles in each state.

People of the country may 2, 3, 4 wheelers for travelling daily. People can have one or more vehicles from different companies. These would like different prices for each 
type of vehicle. Based on the vehicle type, the pollution ejecting value changes. Government will fix certain range for each type of vehicle. Pollution testing centres has to 
verify the pollution of vehicle and record the same. The pollution testing centre has to advise for service of vehicle in certain duration of time for getting pollution certificate.

Also, there is a limited time period (Maximum 15 years) for which a particular type of vehicle can be used before it becomes harmful for the environment. For recycled motors,
this time period could be very less. These recycled vehicles also have exceptional pollution ejecting values which makes their life time lower. This parameter can also be taken
into account while doing the analysis.
